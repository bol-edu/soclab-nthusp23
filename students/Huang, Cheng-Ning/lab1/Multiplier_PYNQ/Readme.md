# Multiplier

Employing the PYNQ-Z2 board (part xc7z020clg400-1) with a clock period of 10ns.

## Design

This design constitutes a 32-bit multiplier. The primary objective of this lab is to acquaint participants with the HLS tool and its workflow. The design is initially created in C++ and subsequently synthesized into Verilog. Following that, the design is implemented in Vivado and synthesized into a bitstream. The validation of the design takes place on the PYNQ-Z2 board, accomplished from within the Jupyter notebook environment.
